 * COSC 455 Programming Languages: Implementation and Design.
 * <p>
 * A Simple Compiler Adapted from Sebesta (2010) by Josh Dehlinger further modified by Adam Conover
 * (2012-2017)
 * <p>
 * A simple compiler used for the simple English grammar in Section 2.2 of Adam Brooks Weber's
 * "Modern Programming Languages" book. Parts of this code was adapted from Robert Sebesta's
 * "Concepts of Programming Languages".
 * <p>
 * This compiler assumes that the source file containing the sentences to parse is provided as the
 * first runtime argument. Within the source file, the compiler assumes that each sentence to parse
 * is provided on its own line.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: A "real" compiler would more likely treat an entire file as a single stream of input,
 * rather than each line being an independent input stream.
